- Wider area is a WAN, these are typically handled by ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
- Internet consists of many WANs.

## Web requests
- Browser sends an HTTP request to web server
- Web server retrieves web page's HTML and sends back in HTTP response
- Browser then renders the response's HTML into a web page

## Types of Web Pages

- Dynamic Web page generated by server program or script, and HTML changes depending on the request

## Languages used

- HTML defines the structure and contents of a web page
- CSS is for formatting these web pages

## How to develop
- Can use either an IDE or a text editor (Vim ftw)
- Deployment is done by transferring the files to a web server with Internet Access. Typically done over FTP

## How to view
- Web pages on the internet are accessed via a URL. 
- URL consists of protocol (http://), domain name (google.com), path (after the domain), and filename (index.php)
- To view locally, editor features, file explorer and right click, and File open in a web browser are all common ways of viewing web pages
- To view the HTML of a web page, right clicking and selecting view source.
- To view the CSS of a web page, Ctrl-click the link in the source code.

- Tells browser that the document uses HTML5 
`<!DOCTYPE html>`
### Document tree
