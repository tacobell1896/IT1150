- Deployment is done by transferring the files to a web server with Internet Access. Typically done over FTP

## How to view
- Web pages on the internet are accessed via a URL. 
- URL consists of protocol (http://), domain name (google.com), path (after the domain), and filename (index.php)
- To view locally, editor features, file explorer and right click, and File open in a web browser are all common ways of viewing web pages
- To view the HTML of a web page, right clicking and selecting view source.
- To view the CSS of a web page, Ctrl-click the link in the source code.
