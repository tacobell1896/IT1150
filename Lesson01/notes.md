# Chapter 01

## Web applications
- consists of clients, server, and network
- clients use web browser
- web browser requests web pages from server
- server returns the requested pages

## Web is a series of Networks
- At lowest level there are LANs, which are your typical home and work networks.
- Wider area is a WAN, these are typically handled by ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
- Internet consists of many WANs.

## Web requests
- Browser sends an HTTP request to web server
- Web server retrieves web page's HTML and sends back in HTTP response
- Browser then renders the response's HTML into a web page

## Types of Web Pages
- Static web page is the same every time it's retrieved, and HTML does not change for it
- Dynamic Web page generated by server program or script, and HTML changes depending on the request

## Languages used
- JavaScript is run by the JavaScript engine of the client's web browser. Processed on the end-user's computer
- HTML defines the structure and contents of a web page
- CSS is for formatting these web pages

## How to develop
- Can use either an IDE or a text editor (Vim ftw)
- Deployment is done by transferring the files to a web server with Internet Access. Typically done over FTP

## How to view
- Web pages on the internet are accessed via a URL. 
- URL consists of protocol (http://), domain name (google.com), path (after the domain), and filename (index.php)
- To view locally, editor features, file explorer and right click, and File open in a web browser are all common ways of viewing web pages
- To view the HTML of a web page, right clicking and selecting view source.
- To view the CSS of a web page, Ctrl-click the link in the source code.

## Critical Issues of web development
1. Usability
2. Cross-browser compatibility
3. User Accessibility
4. Search Engine Optimization
5. Responsive Web Design

# Chapter 02 HTML Syntax

## Basic Structure of Document
### DOCTYPE declaration 
- First line of code in every HTML document.
- Tells browser that the document uses HTML5 
`<!DOCTYPE html>`
### Document tree
- Starts after the Doctype declaration
- Consists of HTML Elements that define content and structure of the page
- **Head** of page is information about the page itself.
- **Body** of page contains the elements that provide the content and structure. 
```
<html>
	<head>
	
	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
</html>
```
### Simple HTML5 Document
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall</title>	
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the San Joaquin Valley Town Hall</p>
		<p>We have some amazing speakers in store for you this season!</p>

## How to code elements and tags
### Elements with opening and closing tags
`<h1></h1>`
`<p></p>`

`<a href="contact.html">`
### Element with multiple attributes
`<a href="contact.html" title="Click to Contact Us" class="nav_link">`
### Element with a boolean value
`<input type="checkbox" name="mailList" checked>`
## Comments and Whitespace
- Comments are useful for explaining functions of code
- Commenting out portions of code is useful when testing a web page and temporarily disabling a portion of the code
- Whitespace is ignored when the HTML document is rendered, but should be used for formatting so that file sizes aren't too large.

# Chapter 02 CSS Syntax
## CSS Style rules
- CSS file consists of style rules
- Style rule consists of selector followed by a set of braces
- Braces contain declarations
