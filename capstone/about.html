                    <h1>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h1>
                    <p>A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard that uses a special switch to put your input into a computer. There are many different mechanical keyboard switches, but some of the most common ones are the various Cherry MX switches, along with knock-off versions such as Outemu and Gateron. Buckling Spring switches are also a popular choice among enthusiasts.</p>
                    <h3>Sounds of switches</h3>
                    <p>Different mechanical keyboard switches have different sounds. Some are a lot louder than others. They also have different feelings when typing on them, so there is something for everyone! Below is a video showing a couple of different switch sounds.</p>
